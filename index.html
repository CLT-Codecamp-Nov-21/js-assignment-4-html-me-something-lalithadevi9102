               <h2>Millennium Park</h2>
               <p>This is my first trip in USA.
                  I have visited this place with my family in 2019 and it’s one of my memorable trip in my life. First place we visited was Millennium Park. It is a public park located in the Chicago Loop, a community area of the city in Illinois.</p>

               <h2>Sky deck Chicago</h2>
               <p>Second place we had an adventurous experience was the sky deck Chicago. Occupying the 103rd floor – that's nine floors higher than 360 CHICAGO – of the 110-story Willis Tower (the second-tallest building in North America after One World Trade Center), Sky deck Chicago boasts breathtaking views of the city.</p>

               <h2>Buckingham Fountain</h2>
               <p>Third place is the Buckingham Fountain which is a stunning sculptural fountain in Grant Park. During display, a center jet shoots water to a height of 150 feet into the air.                </p>

               <h2>Navy Pier</h2>
               <p>Finally we enjoyed the Carousel ride at Navy Pier. Navy Pier is a 3,300-foot-long pier on the shoreline of Lake Michigan. Had fun walking around both at night and during the day. Also enjoyed the fireworks welcoming the New Year.
